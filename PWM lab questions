Lab Question 3.2
Write an application that initializes timer/counter 3 to generate a PWM signal. The period
should be set to 0xFFFF. Set the pulse time to 0xFF.
Lab Question 3.3
What is the PWM period when the timer is configured as above?
Lab Question 3.4
What is the duty cycle for the generated PWM signal?
Now it is time to investigate how short the PWM period time needs to be in order to perceive the light
emitted by the LED as continuous. Throughout this task a duty cycle of 50% should be kept.
â€¢ Change the period of the PWM signal until the light from the LED looks continuous (the output
compare register has to be changed as well).
Lab Question 3.5
How short is the required period time?
When the period time is found, it is possible to modulate the light intensity by changing the duty
cycle.
Lab Question 3.6
The way the 16-bit timer/counter was used here is not good. Why is that?
Lab Question 3.7
What is the effective resolution of the PWM signal?
